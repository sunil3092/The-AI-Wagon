### Objects in python
        Everything is an Object in python. Each object has the following.
        Object
            -> identiy
            -> type
            -> value
### Types of Object
        - Mutable  - Can be changed
        - Immutable - Cannot be changed
    We use `identity` of the object to check if its mutable or immutable
        - if the **identity is changed then its mutable** 
        - if the **identity is not changed then its immutable**

### Numbers
 - Integers
 - Boolean
 - Real (floating -> decimal)
 - Complex Numbers
