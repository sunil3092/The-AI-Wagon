### Objects in python

        Everything is an Object in python. Each object has the following.
        Object
            -> identiy
            -> type
            -> value

### Types of Object

        - Mutable  - Can be changed
        - Immutable - Cannot be changed
    We use `identity` of the object to check if its mutable or immutable
        - if the **identity is changed then its mutable**
        - if the **identity is not changed then its immutable**

## Immutables

### Numbers

- Integers
- Boolean
- Real (floating -> decimal)
- Complex Numbers

### Fractions

- Fractions are treated as strings in Python.

### Strings

Strings are immutable

- Core
- Indexing
- Slicing

### Tuples

Tuples are immutable

## Mutables

### List

## Operator Overloading

Using operators like +, \* .. etc to combine lists, strings ... etc.

### Byte Array
this enables the single sting to use all list related methods.

### Set
Datastructure that we can use to replicate Sets from math and perform operations like intersection, union... etc
A Set always contain uniue item.

### Dictonary
