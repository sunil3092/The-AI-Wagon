## Virtual Envionments and why should we use them.

#### Defination:

        Virtaul environemts create a isolation of dependecy's making sure the environment is consistant to the packages it include.
        - How to create a Virtual environment the classic way
            - Create a folder eg `.env` and go into the folder in the terminal.
            - Run the command `python -m venv .env `
            - Activate the virtual envionment by running the activate command `.env\Scripts\activate`
        - How to add a requirements file.
            - Create a random file like `requiremets.txt` and write the requirements with versions
              if necessary in it, add each requirement on a  new line. e.g `flask==3.0.0`
            - Run command `pip install -r requiremets.txt` to install from the requirements file.

## Organising Projects

#### Structure :

        E-Shop/
            - run.py                    Any direct python file is called a `Module`
            - logic.py
            - businessLogic/
            - utils/                    Any folder that contains __init__.py is called a `Pakage`
                - __init__.py
